# Next Minecraft Server
Next Generation Minecraft Server with complete multi-threaded structures, aiming for best possible performance

This project is purely made for fun, May be discontinued soon but if it's actually completed, It would be something crazy
Current Stages: Not Usable, In development

## Q&A
**1.** Would it be the replacement of any sort of fork for Minecraft Server?
- Nope, It's will have it own APIs to create thing, which means it's not compatible with any Existing platform plugins

**2.** Why am I making this?
- As the descrption, I'm making it for fun, But basically minecraft server original structure is very bad, I wanna try something out of it
