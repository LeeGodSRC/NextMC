# Next Minecraft Server
Next Generation Minecraft Server coded in kotlin without any original Mojang codes, complete multi-threaded based structures, aiming for best possible performance

This project is purely made for fun, May be discontinued soon but if it's actually completed, It would be something crazy
Current Stages: Not Usable, In development

## Q&A
**1.** Would it be the replacement of any sort of fork for Minecraft Server?
- Nope, It's will have it own APIs to create thing, which means it's not compatible with any Existing platform plugins

**2.** Why am I making this?
- As the descrption, I'm making it for fun, But basically minecraft server original structure is very bad, I wanna try something out of it
